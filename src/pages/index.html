            <p>
                Hi, I'm Dan! I'm currently focused on front end development, design, and accessibility. I also dabble in back end development.

                <p>
                    I love designing clean and responsive sites. Coding and web development started as a hobby and grew into my passion and career. I currently focus on front end development.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When I'm not developing I enjoy playing golf, soccer, and hockey. If I'm not doing one of those, chances are I'm watching Arrested Development or 30 Rock. I am a Sabres and Liverpool FC fan. I'm also an avid traveler.
